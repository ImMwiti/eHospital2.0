The majority are caused by spread of infected material from a focus of suppuration elsewhere in the body, notably the PARANASAL SINUSES, middle ear (see EAR, MIDDLE), HEART (see also ENDOCARDITIS, BACTERIAL), and LUNG. Penetrating CRANIOCEREBRAL TRAUMA and NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES may also be associated with this condition. Clinical manifestations include HEADACHE, SEIZURES, focal neurologic deficits, and alterations of consciousness. (Adams et al., Principles of Neurology, 6th ed, pp712-6)",,Diagnosis,N/A,,,,
